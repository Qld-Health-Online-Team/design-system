Each instance of the API class has\n * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n *\n * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n *\n * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n * top level object had. For example, these two calls are equivalent:\n *\n *     // Not chained\n *     api.row.add( {...} );\n *     api.draw();\n *\n *     // Chained\n *     api.row.add( {...} ).draw();\n *\n * @class DataTable.Api\n * @param {array|object|string|jQuery} context DataTable identifier. This is\n *   used to define which DataTables enhanced tables this API will operate on.\n *   Can be one of:\n *\n *   * `string` - jQuery selector. Any DataTables' matching the given selector\n *     with be found and used.\n *   * `node` - `TABLE` node which has already been formed into a DataTable.\n *   * `jQuery` - A jQuery object of `TABLE` nodes.\n *   * `object` - DataTables settings object\n * @param {array} [data] Data to initialise the Api instance with.\n *\n * @example\n *   // Direct initialisation during DataTables construction\n *   var api = $('#example').DataTable();\n *\n * @example\n *   // Initialisation using a DataTables jQuery object\n *   var api = $('#example').dataTable().api();\n *\n * @example\n *   // Initialisation as a constructor\n *   var api = new $.fn.DataTable.Api( 'table.dataTable' );\n */\n_Api = function ( context, data )\n{\n\tif ( !

DataTables has a number of default parameters which\n\t * you can override using this option. Please refer to the jQuery\n\t * documentation for a full description of the options available, although\n\t * the following parameters provide additional options in DataTables or\n\t * require special consideration:\n\t *\n\t * * `data` - As with jQuery, `data` can be provided as an object, but it\n\t *   can also be used as a function to manipulate the data DataTables sends\n\t *   to the server. The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n\t *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending. An\n\t *   object may be returned which will be merged into the DataTables\n\t *   defaults, or you can add the items to the object that was passed in and\n\t *   not return anything from the function. This supersedes `fnServerParams`\n\t *   from DataTables 1.9-.\n\t *\n\t * * `dataSrc` - By default DataTables will look for the property `data` (or\n\t *   `aaData` for compatibility with DataTables 1.9-) when obtaining data\n\t *   from an Ajax source or for server-side processing - this parameter\n\t *   allows that property to be changed. You can use Javascript dotted\n\t *   object notation to get a data source for multiple levels of nesting, or\n\t *   it my be used as a function. As a function it takes a single parameter,\n\t *   the JSON returned from the server, which can be manipulated as\n\t *   required, with the returned value being that used by DataTables as the\n\t *   data source for the table. This supersedes `sAjaxDataProp` from\n\t *   DataTables 1.9-.\n\t *\n\t * * `success` - Should not be overridden it is used internally in\n\t *   DataTables. To manipulate / transform the data returned by the server\n\t *   use `ajax.dataSrc`, or use `ajax` as a function (see below).\n\t *\n\t * `function`\n\t * ----------\n\t *\n\t * As a function, making the Ajax call is left up to yourself allowing\n\t * complete control of the Ajax request.

There are\n\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t *      returned.\n\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t *   initialisation options:\n\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t *    * Parameters:\n\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t *    * Return:\n\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t *        for the data requested.\n\t *\n\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t *\n\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t * with the naming of mRender. If 'mDataProp' is given, then it will still\n\t * be used by DataTables, as it automatically maps the old name to the new\n\t * if required.\n\t *\n\t *  @type string|int|function|null\n\t *  @default null <i>Use automatically calculated column index</i>\n\t *\n\t *  @name DataTable.defaults.column.data\n\t *  @dtopt Columns\n\t *\n\t *  @example\n\t *    // Read table data from objects\n\t *    // JSON structure for each row:\n\t *    //   {\n\t *    //      \"engine\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"browser\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"platform\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"version\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"grade\": {value}\n\t *    //   }\n\t *    $(document).ready( function() {\n\t *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n\t *        \"ajaxSource\": \"sources/objects.txt\",\n\t *        \"columns\": [\n\t *          { \"data\": \"engine\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"browser\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"platform\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"version\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"grade\" }\n\t *        ]\n\t *      } );\n\t *    } );\n\t *\n\t *  @example\n\t *    // Read information from deeply nested objects\n\t *    // JSON structure for each row:\n\t *    //   {\n\t *    //      \"engine\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"browser\": {value},\n\t *    //      \"platform\": {\n\t *    //         \"inner\": {value}\n\t *    //      },\n\t *    //      \"details\": [\n\t *    //         {value}, {value}\n\t *    //      ]\n\t *    //   }\n\t *    $(document).ready( function() {\n\t *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n\t *        \"ajaxSource\": \"sources/deep.txt\",\n\t *        \"columns\": [\n\t *          { \"data\": \"engine\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"browser\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"platform.inner\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"details.0\" },\n\t *          { \"data\": \"details.1\" }\n\t *        ]\n\t *      } );\n\t *    } );\n\t *\n\t *  @example\n\t *    // Using `data` as a function to provide different information for\n\t *    // sorting, filtering and display.

For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t\t * this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t\t *     // token\n\t\t\t * };\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t\t *         // token\n\t\t\t *     }\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t\t * });\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * ```js\n\t\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t\t * ```\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t\t * @public\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\n\t\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.

The last part of the code allows the users to navigate tabs with the keyboard which is an accessibilty requirement. \r\n\r\n        This code will work for multiple tab components on the same page.\r\n\r\n    */\r\n\r\n    // Get all tab components on the page\r\n    const tabComponents = document.querySelectorAll(\".qld__tab-container\");\r\n\r\n    // Loop through each tab component\r\n    tabComponents.forEach((tabComponent) => {\r\n        // Get all tab heading elements within the tab component\r\n        const tabHeadings = tabComponent.querySelectorAll(\".qld__tab-button\");\r\n        // Set tab index and aria-selected attributes for the first tab heading and its corresponding content element\r\n        tabHeadings[0].setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"0\");\r\n        tabHeadings[0].setAttribute(\"aria-selected\", \"true\");\r\n        const tabContentId = tabHeadings[0].getAttribute(\"data-tab\");\r\n        const tabContent = tabComponent.querySelector(\r\n            `.qld__tab-content[data-tab=\"${tabContentId}\"]`\r\n        );\r\n        tabContent.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"0\");\r\n        tabContent.setAttribute(\"aria-hidden\", \"false\");\r\n        // Add the 'active' class to the first tab heading and its corresponding content element\r\n        tabHeadings[0].classList.add(\"active\");\r\n        tabContent.classList.add(\"active\");\r\n        // Loop through each tab heading element\r\n        tabHeadings.forEach((tabHeading) => {\r\n            // Attach a click event listener to the tab heading\r\n            tabHeading.addEventListener(\"click\", (event) => {\r\n                // Remove the 'active' class from all tab heading and content elements\r\n                const tabHeadings = tabComponent.querySelectorAll(\".qld__tab-button\");\r\n                tabHeadings.forEach((tabHeading) => {\r\n                    tabHeading.classList.remove(\"active\");\r\n                    tabHeading.setAttribute(\"aria-selected\", \"false\");\r\n                    tabHeading.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"-1\");\r\n                });\r\n                const tabContents = tabComponent.querySelectorAll(\".qld__tab-content\");\r\n                tabContents.forEach((tabContent) => {\r\n                    tabContent.classList.remove(\"active\");\r\n                    tabContent.setAttribute(\"aria-hidden\", \"true\");\r\n                    tabContent.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"-1\");\r\n                });\r\n                // Add the 'active' class to the clicked tab heading and its corresponding content element\r\n                event.currentTarget.classList.add(\"active\");\r\n                event.currentTarget.setAttribute(\"aria-selected\", \"true\");\r\n                event.currentTarget.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"0\");\r\n                const tabContentId = event.currentTarget.getAttribute(\"data-tab\");\r\n                const tabContent = tabComponent.querySelector(\r\n                    `.qld__tab-content[data-tab=\"${tabContentId}\"]`\r\n                );\r\n                tabContent.classList.add(\"active\");\r\n                tabContent.setAttribute(\"aria-hidden\", \"false\");\r\n                tabContent.setAttribute(\"tabindex\", \"0\");\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        let currentTabIndex = 0;\r\n\r\n        tabHeadings.forEach((tabHeading, index) => {\r\n            tabHeading.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (event) => {\r\n\r\n                // If the key that was pressed was the \"Enter\" or \"Space\" key, treat it as if the tab heading was clicked\r\n                if (event.key === \"Enter\" || event.key === \"Space\") {\r\n                    event.preventDefault();\r\n                    event.currentTarget.click();\r\n                }\r\n                // If the key that was pressed was the left arrow key, switch to the previous tab if not already on the first tab\r\n                if (event.key === \"ArrowLeft\") {\r\n                    if (currentTabIndex > 0) {\r\n                        event.preventDefault();\r\n                        const previousTabHeading = tabHeadings[index -
