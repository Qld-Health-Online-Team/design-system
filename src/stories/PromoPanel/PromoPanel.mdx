# Promo Panel

## Overview

Promotional panels are a key element in web design used to highlight specific content or messages. They act as a visual break on a page, drawing attention to important announcements, new features, or promotional content. These panels typically consist of a combination of text and images designed to engage users and guide them toward a desired action, such as clicking a link or learning more about a particular topic.
