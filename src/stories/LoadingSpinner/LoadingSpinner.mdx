# Loading Spinner

## Overview

A loading spinner, also known as a loading indicator or simply spinner, is a small looped animation used to indicate that content is being loaded or processed.

Its purpose is to provide feedback to the user that the system is working on their request and to manage user expectations during waiting periods. It helps reassure users that the system is active and has not frozen, thus improving the overall user experience during potentially frustrating wait times.

There are three types of loading spinner, default, stacked and minimal.
