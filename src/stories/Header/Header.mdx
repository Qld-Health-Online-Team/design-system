# Header

## Overview

The Header component provides the global branding and primary navigation for Queensland Government websites.

It is typically the first element on the page and is responsible for:

-   Displaying Queensland Government branding
-   Showing the site title and optional subline
-   Providing access to global search
-   Displaying primary call-to-action links
-   Supporting multiple visual themes

The Header is a **layout-level component** and is intended to be used once per page, usually within a page template.
