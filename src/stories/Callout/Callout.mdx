# Callout

## Overview

A callout is a piece of text from an article that has been taken out and used as a visual aid to help show a reader where important information is located.

Callouts are sometimes referred to as "pull quotes" or "highlighted text." In our Design System callouts can also be used as a visual clue to help direct a user's attention to important pieces of information. Our design system also uses a modified callout style for quotes and dates.
