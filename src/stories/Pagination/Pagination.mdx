# Pagination

## Overview

Pagination is used to divide large amounts of content into a series of pages. This allows users to navigate through the content more easily, with controls for moving to the next or previous page, and an option to jump to a specific page. Whether it's search results or product catalogues, pagination helps users browse through the content in a more organised and manageable way.
