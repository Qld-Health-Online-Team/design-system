# CTA Link

## Overview

Call to action (CTA) link is a text-based link that is designed to prompt users to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter.

CTA links are visually distinct instructions to users designed to provoke an immediate response using verbs such as 'call now' or 'find out more'.

Our CTA links are different to buttons which are typically larger and more visually prominent. While both CTA links and buttons are used to encourage users to take a specific action, the main difference between the two is the visual design.

CTA links are typically used for less important actions, such as linking to other important pages within a website while buttons are used for more important actions, such as submitting a form.

It's worth noting that the line between CTA links and buttons can be blurry, and the specific design and implementation of CTAs can vary depending on the website or application.

In our Design System we have 2 styles, a default and view all.
