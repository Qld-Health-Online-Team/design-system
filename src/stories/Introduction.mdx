# Queensland Government Design System - Core

The Queensland Government design system helps teams create consistent, user-centric digital experiences quickly.

## Introduction

We have developed a design system for whole-of-government, to provide a consistent look and feel across Queensland Government's digital properties.

Itâ€™s a solid framework that can be tailored to suit the diverse range of web sites within Queensland.

The tools help designers and developers build consistent, user-focused experiences for our audiences.

## Who is it for?

This design system was originally developed for the Queensland Health community yet designed with a whole-of-government lens. We are now ready to share this first iteration with all of Queensland Government.

You might be an individual or part of a team, looking to make improvements to your site, or establishing a new product as part of a project. The design system will help you reduce time and cost and is fully customisable.

Prior to using QGDS, please liaise with Queensland Online to ensure that the placement of your page (qld.gov.au, corporate, intranet etc) complies with the Digital Services Policy.

If you have already been through the recommendation process with Queensland Online and your site has been endorsed as an approved campaign or corporate site, and is outside the franchise or Forgov model, please contact us to discuss how your team could become a community consumer of the current version of QGDS.
