# Navbar

## Overview

The main navigation component is intended to be used as the primary means of navigation around the website. It typically accommodates the top level of the information architecture.

The main navigation component is designed to work closely with the header component and collapses down to a conventional open/close menu button on smaller devices.

Another important aspect of the primary navigation is the mega-menu. The mega-menu is an optional addition to the primary navigation. It offers a curated list of level 2 child pages for any of the links in the primary navigation bar.

Horizontal navigation is limited to two colours either light or dark.
